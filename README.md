# An Analysis of Election Data and Finding the Results
In this challenge, we take the dataset that we have been working on with Seth and Tom a step further. With this dataset, we had already determined the total votes, the candidates that were voted for, the candidates' voting outcomes, and determined a winner. We now need to add code to provide county voting outcomes. Upon adding this code, we can make some new observations regarding county voting performance, as well as how that impacted the candidates' results.

## Results of the Election Audit
With a now enhanced scope of the election results, we can comment on some of the outcomes of this election:
- There was a total of 369,711 votes cast in this election
- We have each individual county's performance:
  - Jefferson County: Cast 38,855 votes, or 10.5% of the total votes
  - Denver County: Cast 306,055 votes, or 82.8% of the total votes
  - Arapahoe County: Cast 24,801 votes, or 6.7% of the total votes
- The county with the largest number of votes cast was Denver county
